# JWT
### JSON Web Token

Is a means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS) and/or encrypted using JSON Web Encryption (JWE).

#### In simple terms, it is just another way of encoding JSON object and use that encoded object as access tokens for authentication from the server.
