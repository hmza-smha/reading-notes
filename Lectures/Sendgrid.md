## Sending Email with Microsoft Azure

### 1. Create an Azure Subscription

### 2. Create a Twilio SendGrid account

- Select Marketplace
> The Azure Marketplace provides many services, including the Twilio SendGrid email service. You can find it by searching for "Twilio SendGrid." You will also find it under Software as a Service (SaaS).

- Twilio SendGrid account setup

Before sending your first email, you will need to complete the following Twilio SendGrid account setup. These requirements help secure your account and keep your messages from landing in spam folders.

1. Configure Two-factor authentication

> Twilio SendGrid uses Two-factor authentication (2FA) to help protect your account. To enable2FA, Navigate to Two-Factor Authentication in the Twilio SendGrid Settings menu, and click AddTwo-Factor Authentication.  

2. Create an API key

> API Keys authenticate your application, mail client, or website with Twilio SendGrid services. Unlike a username and password, API keys are scoped to provide access only to the services you select. You can also delete and create API keys without impacting your other account credentials. For these reasons, Twilio SendGrid requires you to connect to its services using API keys.


3. Complete Sender Authentication

> Twilio SendGrid requires customers to complete Sender Authentication. This requirement protects your domain's reputation as an email sender and helps uphold legitimate sending behavior by Twilio SendGrid customers.
