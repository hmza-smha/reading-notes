# Queue
### First In First Out, Last In Last Out

Common terminology for a queue is

- **Enqueue** Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- **Dequeue** Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- **Front** This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- **Rear** This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- **Peek** When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- **IsEmpty** returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

### Enqueue O(1)
When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

```
ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   rear.next <-- node
   rear <-- node
```

### Dequeue O(1)
When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.

```
ALGORITHM dequeue()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
// EXCEPTION if queue is empty

   Node temp <-- front
   front <-- front.next
   temp.next <-- null

   return temp.value
```

### Peek O(1)
When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue
// EXCEPTION if Queue is empty

   return front.value
```

### IsEmpty O(1)

```
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return front = NULL
```
