# Encapsulation

In object-oriented programming, encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that  perate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.

Encapsulation focus on Private Data

Encapsulation allows the programmer to hide 
and restrict access to data. 

To achieve encapsulation:
1.Declare the variables with the private access modifier
2.Create public getters and setters that allow indirect 
access to those variables
