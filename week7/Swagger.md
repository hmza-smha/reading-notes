# What is Swagger ?
### Swagger is an open source api documentation that helps us to understand API service methods.
### When we consume a web API, then understanding its various methods and verbs can be challenging for a developer.  This solves the problem of generating documentation.  It's also known as OpenAPI.

It allows both computers and humans to understand the capabilities of a REST API without direct accessto the source code. Its main goals are to:
#### Minimize the amount of work needed to connect decoupled services.
#### Reduce the amount of time needed to accurately document a service.

## Again, WHAT IS SWAGGER ?
#### Swagger allows you to describe the structure of your APIs, so that machines can read them. The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the root of all awesomeness in Swagger.

### Why is it so great?
#### Well, by reading your API’s structure, we can automatically build beautiful and interactive API documentation.

### We can also automatically generate client libraries for your API in many languages and explore other possibilities like automated testing.

Swagger does this by asking your API to return a *YAML* or *JSON* that contains a detailed description of your entire API. This file is essentially a resource listing of your API which adheres to OpenAPI Specification. The specification asks you to include information like:
1. What are all the operations that your API supports?
2. What are your API’s parameters and what does it return?
3. Does your API need some authorization?
4. And even fun things like terms, contact information and license to use the API.
